🚀 What is the Accelerator?
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​The Accelerator Programme focuses on recruiting and training candidates who are recent graduates. Candidates get trained to quickly get into their new role of a Junior Engineer at IKEA Group Digital. They learn how engineering is done at Ingka and gain in-depth knowledge of the IKEA business and practices.

The candidates are embedded in their product team from day one. Their time is divided between on-the-job work (50-60%) and program activities (40-50%).
